# Extreme Weather Events Detection

This project focuses on predicting extreme weather events using machine learning techniques. The repository contains code to load, clean, preprocess, and analyze weather data, as well as train and evaluate various machine learning models for predicting extreme weather events.

## Overview

Extreme weather events pose significant risks to communities and infrastructure, making accurate prediction crucial for disaster preparedness and response. In this project, we leverage historical weather data to train machine learning models capable of identifying extreme weather patterns.

## Data

The project utilizes historical weather data, specifically precipitation data, collected over a period of time. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare it for model training. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of extreme weather events.

## Extreme Events Definition

Extreme events are defined based on predefined thresholds, such as percentiles, for each location. These thresholds help categorize weather events as either normal or extreme. The Extreme Events Definition section outlines the process of labeling extreme events and preparing the data for model training.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are trained and evaluated for their predictive performance. Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting extreme weather events.

## Conclusion

The project concludes with insights into the performance of each model and recommendations for leveraging predictive modeling techniques to enhance resilience to extreme weather events. The findings highlight the potential of machine learning in informing decision-making processes and developing proactive measures to mitigate the impact of extreme weather.
